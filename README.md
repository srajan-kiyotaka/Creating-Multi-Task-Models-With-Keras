# **Creating Multi Task Models With Keras**

## **About The Project!**

I used the keras and Tensorflow Library, To build a Deep Learning Neural Network to Creating Multi Task Models.

I used anaconda jupyter notebook but google colab can also be used.

The Model Will Detect Two Features at a Same Time From a Photo : That is to Determine The Number and The Predominant Colour. We used The Mnist Dataset.

## **Visual Representation!**

**Here, The Image Contain Some Noice and a Predominant Colour.**
