# **Creating Multi Task Models With Keras**

## **About The Project**

I used the keras and Tensorflow Library, To build a Deep Learning Neural Network to Creating Multi Task Models.

<br>

I used anaconda jupyter notebook but google colab can also be used.

<br>

The model will detect two features at a same time from a photo : that is to determine the number and the predominent colour. We used Mnist Dataset.

## **Visual Representation!**

**Here, The First Image is The Contenr Image and Second Image is The Style Image.**

**Here, The First Image is The Image Generated By The model and second Image is The content Image.**

## **Control Intencity!**

**Here, There are Different Images with Different Intencity, We Can Control The intencity by Changing The Values of The Epochs!**
